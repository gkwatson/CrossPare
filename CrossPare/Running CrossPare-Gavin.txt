Running CrossPare
---------------------------------

-Clone from GitHub

-Top level project file to run is: src/main/java/de/ugoe/cs/cpdp/Runner.java

-Add command-line argument(s) to Runner
	-each argument is name of an xml config file similar to the ones in testdata/configurations/
	-argument can also be a folder of config files

-install Java 8

-Install and import project into Eclipse (or create new setup)

-install mysql-server (can do without if removing <storage name="MySQLResultStorage" param="" /> line from config file)
	-in terminal to set up sql database
	 with default crosspare tables: 	mysql -u root -p
						GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'crosspare'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'crosspare';
						CREATE DATABASE crosspare;
						USE crosspare;
						SOURCE sql/setup-db.sql

-Many label files for the CrossPare provided config files are not present in this repository. Only the JURECZKO labels can be found in testdata/JURECZKO.
 This folder contains one folder per project for all of the projects in this dataset. Each file in a project folder is the various versions of the project.

-To easily make new config file for your data, copy a JURECZKO file, change elements loader:name, loader:datalocation, and resultspath:path based on the
 extension of your files, the folder you dropped your projects in, and where you want the resulting csv file to be created.

-Currently supported loaders are the "***FolderLoader" files located in src/main/java/de/ugoe/cs/cpdp/loader
